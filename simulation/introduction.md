# introduction

## motivation
- manual manners aren't practical
- automatic design flow: HDL -> RTL -> netlist -> placement -> routing, only HDL needs manual implement
- core operation: circuit design -> **math modeling** -> **simulation** -> **optimization** -> ...
- complexity grows, 90% design cycle time on simulation and verification
- learn:
    - mathematical circuit modeling
    - numerical analysis
    - programming skills


## main contents
1. basic modeling techniques
2. solution of linear circuit equations
3. principles and techniques of circuit simulation
4. modeling and simulation of interconnect and power ground network
5. power and thermal optimization in VLSI circuits
6. introduction of other topics in VLSI design automation
