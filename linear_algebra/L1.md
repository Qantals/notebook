## geometry explanation of equations
> binary-equations: $Ax=b$ A(2,2) x(2,1) b(2,1)
- row picture: draw two lines and get the cross point solution
- column picture: $x*A(:,1)+y*A(:,2)=b$, x,y are scalars, this compose to vector $\vec{b}$
- in high dimension, column picture is better for equation resolving, because find linear composition is much easier than find the intersection
- existence of solution: matrix should not be **singularity** case/not invertable/not independence
    - w.r.t. a,b,c vectors should not in a common plane.
    - not independent: for a,b,c: c is linear combination of a,b

## matrix multiplication(matrix * column vector = column vector)
- #1: A is combination of column vectors, split element of x as scalar coefficient. Then sum up.(linear combination of column of A)
- #2: A is combination of row vectors, for each row ans is dot product of row of A and vector x.
