## geometry explanation of equations
> binary-equations: $A_{2\times 2}x_{2\times 1}=b_{2\times 1}$
- row picture: draw two lines and get the cross point solution
- column picture: $x_1\times A_{:1} + x_2\times A_{:2}=\vec{b}$
- column picture is better in high dimension.
- existence of solution: matrix should not be **singularity** case / not invertable / not independence

## matrix multiplication
- matrix * column vector = column vector
    1. A is combination of column vectors, split element of x as scalar coefficient. Then sum up.(linear combination of column of A)
    2. A is combination of row vectors, for each row ans is dot product of row of A and vector x.
