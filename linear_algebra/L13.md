## review
- $A^2=0$ but $A\ne 0$: $A=[0\ 1;0\ 0]$
- $N(CD)=N(D)$ where $C$ is invertable.
    > proof: row operation doesn't change solution.
- for square matrix, row space may not equal to column space. e.g. $A=[0\ 1;0\ 0]$
- if $A,B$ are the same in four fundamental space, $A$ can be not in times realtion with $B$: $A,B$ are invertable.
- exchanging rows result in row space and null space hold.
- only zero vector can be shared vector in row space and null space.
