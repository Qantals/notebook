## solve linear equation $Ax=b$
- particular solution $x_p$: set all free variables to zero. Back substitution.
- complete solution: $x=x_p+x_n$(null/special solutions)
    > proof: $Ax_p=b,Ax_n=0 \to A(x_p+x_n)=b$
- full rank
    - $r\le m,r\le n$
    - full column rank $r=n<m$: $R=[I;O]$(no free variables), $N(A)=\vec{0}\to x=x_p$ means unique solution(has 1/0 solution)
    - full row rank $r=m<n$: can be solved by any $b$, $R=[I\ F]$($n-m$ free variables), has $\infty$ solutions.
    - $r=m=n$: can be solved by any $b$, $R=I$, $N(A)=\vec{0}$, has 1 solution.
- supplement: $r=m$ must have solution, $r<m$ depends on $b$. Number of solutions depends on null space.
- $r<m,r<n$: $R=[I\ F;0\ 0]$ has 0/$\infty$ solutions.
