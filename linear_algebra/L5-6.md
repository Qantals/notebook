## vector space
- definition: all vectors in a space, require closure to linear operation(still in this space)
- example: $\mathbb{R^2}$ is ~, compose to a plane. $\mathbb{R^n}$ space has all n-dimension vectors, each has n scalars in $\mathbb{R}$
- zero vector: any vector scalar multiply zero is zero vector, so it must be contained in any space.
- subspace: for $\mathbb{R^3}$ (not in a plane), has:
    1. P: plane across origin(common plane)
    2. L: line across origin(common line)
    3. origin
- operation on subspace
    - union: $P\cup L\ (L\subsetneq P)$ is not a vector space
    - intersection: $P\cap L\ (L\subsetneq P)$ is a vector space, the same as intersection of any subspace
- column space: each column vector in matrix $A$ (and their linear combinations) compose a space: $C(A)$
    - It is a subspace of $\mathbb{R^r}$, A(r X c)
    - equation $Ax=b$, $Ax$ is linear combinations of column vectors of $A$, w.r.t. $C(A)$.
        - **solution existence**: $b$ is in $C(A)$
    - pivot column: remove dependent term from column vectors of $A$
- null space(零空间): $Ax=0$ for all **solution** x compose a space: $N(A)$
    > proof(using algebra):  
    > addition closure: $Av=Aw=0,A(v+w)=0$  
    > scalar multiplication closure: $Av=0\to cAv=0,A(cv)=0$
    - It is a subspace of $\mathbb{R^c}$, A(r X c)
- solution space $Ax=b$ may not existence, because $x=0$ may not be the solution.(It's a plane that doesn't cross the origin)
