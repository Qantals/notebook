## vector space (L5, L6)
- definition: all vectors in a space require closure to linear operation (still in this space)
- example: $\mathbb{R^2}$ is ~, compose to a plane. $\mathbb{R^n}$ space has all n-dimension vectors, each has n scalars in $\mathbb{R}$
- zero vector: any vector scalar multiply zero is zero vector, so it must be contained in any space.
- subspace of $\mathbb{R^3}$ has:
    1. P: plane across origin(common plane)
    2. L: line across origin(common line)
    3. origin
- operation on subspace is subspace?
    - union: No. example: $P\cup L\ (L\subsetneq P)$ is not a vector space
    - intersection: Yes. example: $P\cap L\ (L\subsetneq P)$ is a vector space.
- column space: each column vector in matrix $A$ and their linear combinations compose a space: $C(A)$
    - It is a subspace of $\mathbb{R^r}$ for $A_{r\times c}$.
    - equation $Ax=b$, $Ax$ is linear combinations of column vectors of $A$, w.r.t. $C(A)$.
        - **solution existence**: $b$ is in $C(A)$
    - pivot column: independent vectors in $C(A)$
- null space: $Ax=0$ for all **solution** $x$ compose a space: $N(A)$
    > proof (using algebra):  
    > addition closure: $Av=Aw=0,A(v+w)=0$  
    > scalar multiplication closure: $Av=0\to cAv=0,A(cv)=0$
    - It is a subspace of $\mathbb{R^c}$ for $A_{r\times c}$.
- state space
    - $x_1(t),\dots ,x_n(t)$ system state variables
    - $X=(x_1(t),\dots)$ system state vector
