## graphs & networks
> Graph = {nodes=4, edges=5}
- incidence matrices $A$ (关联矩阵): column means nodes(n=4), row means edges(m=5), -1 means start, 1 means stop.
    - $e=Ax=0,x=c[1;1;1;1],dim(N(A))=1$
    - $x=x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4$ are protential nodes(势能点), $x_m-x_n$ are potential differences(电势差), $e$ is protential(电势).
    - loop: corresponds to dependent.
    - $rank=3$: set one node as ground(remove), other three nodes(columns) are independent.
- kirchhoff's current law: $f=A^Ty=0,dim(N(A^T))=m-r=2$($f$ is outside current source)
    - $y=Ce$(Ohm's law, $C$ is conductance) means current(same node iterates all edges, negitive sing means leaving out the node).
    - basis for $N(A^T)$: seeking for all (smallest) meshes, makes loop added up to zero.
- total equation: $A^TCAx=f$
- Eluer's formula(any graph has this property): $dim(N(A^T))=m-r$ means #loops=#edges-(#nodes-1), i.e. #nodes-#edges+#loops=1
- tree: graph without loop. Get it by choosing pivot columns from $A^T$.
