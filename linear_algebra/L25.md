## review 2
- for differential equation, power of projection matrix is itself.
- $4\times 4$ matrix has 4 eigenvalues
    - invertable: no zero eigenvalues
        > proof: invertable -> $Ax=0$ must be $x=0$ -> $\lambda =0,Ax=0x,x=0$
    - $\det A^{-1}=\prod _i \frac{1}{\lambda _i}$
    - trace of $A+I=\sum \lambda +4$
- see complex eigenvalues to judge convergence: write as exponent form, see its arg(幅角) so we get its power and trendency
- special matrix and find law: $A_4=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 2 & 0\\ 0 & 2 & 0 & 3 \\ 0 & 0 & 3 & 0 \end{bmatrix}=A_4^T$, its projection matrix is $I$ because $A_4$ is invertable, and column space is 4-dimension, w.r.t. it's full rank. Guess odd order is singular, even order is invertable. Judgement: eigenvalues have zero or not / determinant
