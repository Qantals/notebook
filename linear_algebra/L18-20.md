# determinants(eigen value)

## definition
- properities(1~3 are base):
    1. $\det I=1$
    2. exchange rows reverse the sign. So permutation $\det P=1/-1$(divided to odd/even type)
    3. behave like linear function row-wise(extract times/split addition).
    4. 2 equal rows lead to $\det =0$ (proof: from property 2)
    5. holds when subtract l*row_i from row_j (proof: from property 4/3)
    6. row of zeros lead to $\det =0$ (proof: from property 3 make $t=0$)
    7. $\det U=d_1d_2\dots d_n$ where $d_n$ are diagonals, $U$ is upper triangle matrix. (proof: from property 5 using elimination, then use property 1/3 extract $t$ from all rows)
    8. $\det A=0$ when A is singular(proof: row of zeros), $\det  A\ne 0$ when A is invertable.
    9. $\det AB=(\det A)(\det B)$ (proof: from property 5 do elimination to get elementary matrices and pivots, and use block matrix $[A\ 0;E\ B]\to [E\ B-AB;0\ AB]$)
        - $\det A^{-1}=1/\det A$
        - $\det A^2=(\det A)^2$
        - $\det 2A=2^{n}\det A$
    10. $\det A^T=\det A$ (proof: $A=LU$ to get triangle matrix, then use property 7 and 9)
- pivot formula: split each row with each elements using property 3, leaving useful ones which have non-zero elements in each row and column
- big formula: $\det A=\sum_{n!\mathrm{terms}}\pm a_{1\alpha}a_{2\beta}\dots$ where $\alpha ,\beta$ are permutations of $(1\dots n)$, the sign depends on exchange times of rows (inversion number) : even is positive and odd is negative (see property 2).
    > illustration: split determinant to $n!$ terms using property 3 so that each row and column has only one non-zero element  
    > so determinant of these is not zero (avoid row of zeros after elimination by *pivot formula*),  
    > inversion number: iterate all numbers, and sum up all times that number before is bigger than this number.  
    > see insertion sort for principle.
- cofactors of $a_{ij}\to C_{ij}=\pm \det$ (n-1) matrix without row $i$ and col $j$. $i+j=$ even $\to +$, odd $\to -$
- cofactor formula: along any row(be careful: sign hides in cofactors-代数余子式).
- tridiagonal matrix(三对角矩阵): diagonal and sub-diagonal has elements, others are zero. $\det A_n=\det A_{n-1}-\det A_{n-2}$(proof: expand with row_1)

## inverse formula
- $A^{-1}=\frac{1}{\det A}C^T$ where $C$ is cofactor matrix(conmosed of $C_{ij}$), but $C^T$ is adjugate matrix 伴随矩阵.
- check: $AC^T=(\det A)I$ where transpose make it easy to compute matrix multiplication. Elements 1 mean computes $\det A$, and elements 0 mean computing determinants of singular matrix (has same row!)
- $C$: multiplication means replacement of $A$ and compute the determinant.

## Cramer's rule
- $Ax=b,x=A^{-1}b=\frac{1}{\det A}C^Tb\to x_j=\frac{\det B_j}{\det A}$
- $B_j=[b\mathrm{(the\ j-th\ column)},\ (n-1)\mathrm{columns\ of\ }A]$
    > proof: expand $\det B_j$ with column $j$: row $j$ of $C^T$ means column $j$ of $C$, then replace $A_{\_ j}$ with $b$

## volume(geometry significance)
- row vectors of three base edges make up of a matrix $A,|\det A|$ is the volume of parallel hexahedron 平行六面体.
- proof:
    - determinant property 1: $A=Q,\det Q=\pm 1$ (proof: $QQ^T=I\to \det QQ^T=(\det Q)^2=1$)
    - property 2: exchange rows doesn't change volume.
    - property 3a: $\lambda$ times of one row, the volume and determinant increase the same size $\lambda$.
    - property 3b: parallelogram 平行四边形, 2-dim example:$(a,b),(c,d),(0,0),(a+c,b+d)$. $\begin{vmatrix}a+a' & b+b' \\ c & d\end{vmatrix}=\begin{vmatrix}a & b \\ c & d\end{vmatrix}+\begin{vmatrix}a' & b' \\ c & d\end{vmatrix}$ then switch det to area to prove.
- area of parallelogram=$\det [a\ b;c\ d]$
- area of triangle=$\frac{1}{2}\det [a\ b;c\ d]$(see the law of sinces)
- triangle: $(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),(x_3,y_3)$. $A=\begin{bmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$. illustration: subtract row_1 from other rows means goes back to origin and has two point like (a,b) and (c,d), then expand along third column.
