## LU decomposition
- $EA=U$, thus $A=E^{-1}U=LU$, $L$ is lower triangular matrix
- Get $U$: Gauss manner. Get $L$: because $L=E^{-1}$, $L$ is inverse transformation of getting $U$. Just directly copy them to the correct position.
    > proof: Due to property of $(AB)^{-1}=B^{-1}A^{-1}$, the elementary operation results in $L$ has reverse order, thus these coefficients are preserved and independent.
- more common expression: $PA=LU$ where $P$ is permutation that exchange rows.

## permutation matrix
- definition: a square matrix for each row and column only exists one 1, others are zero.
- application: exchange row/column
- property:
    - $P^{-1}=P^T$
        > proof: use matrix multiplication: $P^{-1}P=I$, for diagonal of $I$, requires position of one in row of $P^{-1}$ matches the position of one in column of $P$. This indicates transpose.
    - n-matrix has $n!$ permutation matrices as a group($A_n^n$)
    - Multiplication of any two matrices from this group still in this group.
