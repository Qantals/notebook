## projection
- if $b$ in column space, $Pb=b$; if $b \bot$ column space, $Pb=0$($b$ is in left null space, $A^Tb=0$).
    > proof: from expression of $Pb$, substitude $b$ with $Ax$ and $A^Tb=0$ respectively.
- $e=b-p=b-Pb=(I-P)b$, so $(I-P)$ is also a project matrix, just perpendicular to that of $P$(where $e$ lies)(left null space).

## least square
- to solve $Ax=b$, need to minimize $\left \| Ax-b\right \|^2 =\left \| e\right \|^2$
- normal equations(正规方程组): solve $A^TA\hat{x}=A^Tb$
- let second derivative be zero from minimization term and get normal equations.
- project $b$ to $C(A)$
