## Gaussian elimination
- pivot: the first non-zero element of each row
    - invertable: pivot doesn't contain zero, has solution
- elementary row operations (elementary matrix):
    1. $E_{ij}$ exchange rows $i,j$ : make the pivot for each row exists.
    2. $E_{i}(c)$ multiply line $i$ with $c$ times to make the pivot be one.
    3. $E_{ij}(c)$ multiply row $i$ with $c$ times and add to row $j$ to make all elements below the pivot in the same column be zero.
    - elementary matrix (must be invertable matrix) can be obtained by doing elementary operations on a identity matrix.
    - multiply left operates row, and multiply right operates column
    - $E^{-1}$ means inverse elementary operation (1-3: $E_{ij},E_{i}(\frac{1}{c}),E_{ij}(-c)$).
    - all invertable matrices are equivalent, using elementary matrix left and right multiply it.
        > matrix equivalence: $A_{m\times n}\cong B_{m\times n}$ means $A$ can be transformed to $B$ with elementary operation, i.e. $A=PBQ$ where $P$ and $Q$ is product of elementary.
- result: get upper triangular matrix $U_{N\times N}$, which has $N$ pivot (unreduced row echelon form).
- computing resource: assume $A_{100\times 100}$, need $\sum_{k=1}^{100}k^2$ times element-wise addition / multiplication (first row is multiplication, others are additions)
    - estimation using calculus: $\int_{1}^{100} x^2\mathrm{d}x$
