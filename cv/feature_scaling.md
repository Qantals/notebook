## reasons
- L2 depends on data of larger scale
- gradient descent need more iterations
- get rid of impact of dimension(量纲)

linear transformation(keep some features)

## manners
- max-min normalization 归一化
    > non-dimensional  
    > max/min is sensitive to anormaly/outlier data
- standardization(Z-score): standard normal distribution 标准化
    > convergence speed  
    > improved precision(non-dimensional)  
    > easy to compute  
    > useful when anomaly/outlier occurs
